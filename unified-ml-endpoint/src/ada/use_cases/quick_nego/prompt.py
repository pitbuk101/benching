        • **Email Refinement:** Would you like to adjust the tone of this email (more aggressive, collaborative, or formal)?
        • **Objective Modification:** Should we modify the primary objective or add additional negotiation goals?
        • **Data Enhancement:** Do you have any additional information or data points that could strengthen our negotiation strategy?

        **Context-Specific Questions (adapt based on negotiation scenario):**
        - If cost-focused: "Would you like to emphasize different cost reduction levers or payment terms?"
        - If relationship-sensitive: "Should we adjust the approach to be more partnership-focused?"
        - If urgent timeline: "Do you need to accelerate the negotiation timeline or add urgency elements?"
        - If complex contract: "Are there specific contract terms or service levels we should highlight?"
        - If competitive situation: "Should we strengthen our alternative supplier positioning?"

        **Strategic Enhancement Options:**
        • **Market Intelligence:** Would additional competitor analysis or market research strengthen your position?
        • **Stakeholder Alignment:** Do you need variations of this email for different stakeholders (legal, finance, operations)?

        Frame questions specifically based on:
        - User's stated objectives and priorities
        - Supplier relationship dynamics identified through research
        - Market conditions and competitive landscape
        - Contract complexity and value
        - Timeline constraints and urgency factors

        This ensures follow-up questions are highly relevant to the specific negotiation context and user intent.

        **Self-Analysis Protocol:**
        1. Conduct comprehensive research to fill data gaps
        2. Use industry standards and benchmarks
        3. Make informed assumptions based on available intelligence
        4. Ask only essential clarifying questions (max 2-3)

        ### Step 4A: Dynamic Objective Selection from Insights
        **"Based on our research insights, here are the recommended objectives for this supplier:"**
        **Select one or more objectives that align with your negotiation goals:**
        
        **AVAILABLE OBJECTIVES (Generated from insights analysis):**
        [Display only objectives that were identified from the supplier insights/analysis]
        
        **APPROVED OBJECTIVE TYPES (for validation):**
        1. **Negotiate Price Reduction**
        2. **Negotiate Payment Terms** 
        3. **Achieve Compliance Enforcement**
        4. **Negotiate Volume Discounts**
        5. **Optimize Contractual Terms**

        **OBJECTIVE INPUT PROCESSING:**
        When receiving objectives in JSON format:
        ```json
        {
            "objectives": [
                {
                    "objective_type": "[One unique type from approved list]",
                    "objective_details": "**Summary**\\n\\n[summary content]\\n\\n**Details:**\\n\\n[details content]\\n\\n**Actions:**\\n\\n[actions content]"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        
        **OBJECTIVE FORMATTING PROTOCOL:**
        
        1. **Filter Validation:** Only process objectives with approved objective_types (log/ignore others)
        2. **Group by Type:** Organize all objectives by their objective_type
        3. **Extract Content:** Parse objective_details to separate Summary, Details, and Actions
        4. **Format Output:** Display each objective type as structured content
        
        **OUTPUT FORMAT STRUCTURE:**
        For each valid objective type found, display as:
        
        ```markdown
        ## [OBJECTIVE_TYPE]
        
        ### Summary
        [Extracted summary content - remove **Summary** header and \\n\\n formatting]
        
        ### Details  
        [Extracted details content - remove **Details:** header and \\n\\n formatting]
        
        ### Actions
        [Extracted actions content - remove **Actions:** header and \\n\\n formatting]
        
        ---
        ```
        
        **CONTENT EXTRACTION RULES:**
        - Remove markdown formatting artifacts (\\n\\n, **, etc.)
        - Clean up section headers (**Summary**, **Details:**, **Actions:**) 
        - Preserve bullet points and structured content within sections
        - Maintain original content meaning and context
        - Handle multiple objectives of same type by combining or numbering them
        


        ### Step 4B: Targeted Follow-up Questions (Only for Selected Objectives)
        **After user selects their objectives, ask follow-up questions only for the selected types:**

        **CONDITIONAL FOLLOW-UP LOGIC:**
        ```python
        selected_objectives = user_selected_objectives  # List of selected objective types
        
        follow_up_questions = []
        
        if "Negotiate Price Reduction" in selected_objectives:

        if "Optimize Contractual Terms" in selected_objectives:
            follow_up_questions.append("Which contract terms are most problematic - SLAs, liability, termination clauses?")
        
        # Display only relevant follow-up questions
        for question in follow_up_questions:
            display_question(question)
        ```
        
        **FOLLOW-UP QUESTION MAPPING:**
        - **"Negotiate Price Reduction"** → Target cost reduction percentage or savings amount?
        - **"Negotiate Payment Terms"** → Desired payment terms?
        - **"Achieve Compliance Enforcement"** → Specific compliance gaps identified?
        - **"Negotiate Volume Discounts"** → Realistic volume commitments?
        - **"Optimize Contractual Terms"** → Most problematic contract terms?
        
        ### Step 4C: Objective Confirmation & Positioning Setup

        ### Step 4D: Objective Modification Flow (If user selects Modify Objectives)
        
        **"Which aspect would you like to modify?"**
        1. **Change Primary Focus** - Select different objectives from available insights
        2. **Adjust Specific Objective** - Modify content of existing selected objectives  
        3. **Add New Objective** - Include additional objectives from insights
        4. **Remove Objective** - Exclude specific selected objectives
        
        **MODIFICATION PROCESSING:**
        - Maintain same formatting standards
        - Re-validate against approved objective types
        - Only show objectives available from insights analysis
        - Preserve data consistency across modified objectives
        - Update display using same formatting protocol
        
        ### Step 4E: Objective Analysis Display (If user selects View Detailed Analysis)
        
        **Show supporting analysis for each selected objective:**

        - Market intelligence supporting the approach
        - Risk assessment for each negotiation area
        - Success probability and potential impact
        - Alternative approaches considered
        
        **PROCESSING NOTES:**
        - Always validate objective_type against approved list
        - Only display objectives generated from supplier insights
        - Handle malformed objective_details gracefully  
        - Log any objectives with invalid types for debugging
        - Ensure consistent formatting across all objectives
        - Preserve data integrity during content extraction
        - Support both single and multiple objectives per type
        - Ask follow-up questions only for user-selected objectives

        - You must have consistent information across objectives. There MUST NOT be data or information mismatch or contradicting data. Example: if payment terms are mentioned in an objective, you must not mention different values in different objectives. You must be consistent.
        - All monetary values **must use the supplier's currency symbol**: {currency_symbol}
        - **Do not fabricate** any price, volume, cost driver, or payment term value. Use only what's provided in the data.

        == Step 1: Filter and Classify Objectives ==
        From the data, derive distinct, high-impact negotiation objectives. Classify each using one of the following **approved objective types** (no repetition allowed):
        
        - Negotiate Price Reduction
        - Negotiate Payment Terms
        - Discuss Compliance Enforcement
        - Discuss Category and SKU Cost Models
        - Negotiate Volume Discounts
        - Optimize Contractual Terms

        NOTE: You don't have to include all objective types, only those which have high impact based on the available data.

        For each objective:
        - Include only **analytics and insights relevant to that specific objective**.
        - Exclude those unrelated, or that imply switching suppliers/geographies.

        == Step 2: Data Use Rules ==
        - Do not alter, guess, or invent any metric.  
        - Do not reference benchmarks unless the data includes a market price, cost driver, or target explicitly.
        - Avoid negative days (e.g., "–8 days" becomes "8 days earlier").
        - Only use data that is explicitly provided in the insights.
        - **If critical details are missing or insufficient**: Use your expertise to analyze the available data and identify potential negotiation opportunities based on procurement best practices, but clearly indicate when assumptions are being made.

        == Step 3: Logical Constraints ==
        - Discard price levers where price dropped despite volume increase (unless logically explained).
        - Ignore gaps below inflation or negative price deltas unless significant.
        - Disregard list price variance if unit price trend is favorable.
        - Ensure all objectives are based on substantial data points, not minor variations.
        - **When data is limited**: Apply procurement analysis principles to identify patterns, anomalies, or standard negotiation opportunities that would typically exist in {category} procurement with suppliers like {supplier}.

        == Step 4: Structure of Each Objective ==
        Each objective must include:

        **Summary:**  
        - Open with a commercial context derived from the supplier profile. Mention key metrics: payment terms, contract status, PO usage, financial risk, price/cost variances.
        - Highlight a clear value gap using facts from analytics/insights.
        - If only one SKU is affected, name it and reference percentage variance (no savings amount).  
        - If multiple SKUs are impacted, provide the % range and flag inefficiencies across the group.

        **Details:**  
        - List key SKUs or categories that support the objective.
        - For each, show:  
        "<SKU>: Cost gap of <percent>%, savings potential of {currency_symbol}<amount> based on available data."
        - Only include SKUs and amounts that are explicitly provided in the insights data.
        - **If specific SKU details are not available**: Analyze the category and supplier context to identify typical negotiation leverage points, but clearly mark these as "Analysis-based" rather than "Data-based".

        **Actions:**  
        - Recommend specific negotiation steps, measurable outcomes, and leverage points.
        - Where applicable, quantify the working capital unlocked, savings realized, or process improvements achieved.
        - Base recommendations on the actual data provided, not assumptions.

        == Data Sufficiency Protocol ==
        **When sufficient data is available:**
        - Use specific metrics, percentages, and amounts from the insights data
        - Reference exact SKUs, contract terms, and financial figures
        - Base all recommendations on concrete evidence

        **When data is insufficient or missing:**
        - Apply your procurement expertise to analyze the supplier-category combination
        - Identify typical negotiation opportunities for {category} with suppliers like {supplier}
        - Use industry standards and best practices to formulate objectives
        - Clearly indicate assumptions with phrases like "Based on analysis" or "Typical for this category"
        - Focus on standard procurement levers: volume consolidation, payment terms optimization, contract standardization, compliance improvements
        - Output only valid, parsable JSON.
        - Use professional, no-fluff procurement language. Avoid vague suggestions.
        - Do not repeat any `objective_type`.
        - Include fields:
            - `id`: Sequential index number starting from 0
            - `objective`: Full formatted text block with Summary, Details, and Actions sections
            - `objective_type`: One of the allowed unique types listed above
            - `objective_reinforcements`: Leave as an empty list []
            - `list_of_skus`: Include all SKUs referenced in the objective

        == Final Deliverable Format ==
        Output exactly as a JSON object, without markdown code blocks, preamble, or extra explanation. Format:

        {{
            "objectives": [
                {{
                    "objective_type": "[One unique type from approved list]",
                    "objective_details": "**Summary**\\n\\n[summary content]\\n\\n**Details:**\\n\\n[details content]\\n\\n**Actions:**\\n\\n[actions content]"
                }}
            ]
        }}

        == Special Triggers ==
        Apply these triggers only when supported by data:
        - If high spend without PO, Contract, or Material Reference: trigger "Discuss Compliance Enforcement"
        - If cost driver (e.g., aluminum, energy) changed significantly: trigger "Discuss Category and SKU Cost Models"
        - If financial risk or profit/revenue drop is detected: trigger "Optimize Contractual Terms"
        - If unused discounts or short payment terms exist: trigger "Negotiate Volume Discounts" or "Negotiate Payment Terms"
        - If pricing or terms vary widely across business units: trigger "Optimize Contractual Terms"

        Now, based on the data available, generate **strong negotiation objectives** tailored for supplier {supplier} and category {category}. 
        
        **If sufficient data exists**: Create data-driven objectives with specific metrics and evidence.
        **If data is limited**: Use your procurement expertise to analyze the supplier-category combination and create analysis-based objectives focusing on standard negotiation opportunities and industry best practices for {category} procurement.
