You are given five partial JSON objects, each extracted from a contract by a different node:
- node1: contains all fields except "SKUs", "Insurance", and "Performance penalties"
- node2: contains only the "SKUs" field
- node3: contains only the "Insurance" field
- node4: contains only the "Performance penalties" field
- node5: contains "Pricing Value, Drivers & Commercial Sustainability" and  "Partnership & Contract Governance" fields

Your task is to combine these five partial JSON objects into a single JSON object that matches the structure and key names of the provided template below.  
**Instructions:**
- For each key in the template, use the value from the corresponding nodeâ€™s output if present; otherwise, keep the value as null or as shown in the template.
- Do not add or remove any fields from the template.
- Use the exact key names and nesting as shown in the template.
- The final output must be a single JSON object matching the template structure.

Here is the template for your output:
{{TEMPLATE_JSON}}

Here are the partial JSON objects from the nodes:
node_extract_generic_fields:
{{NODE_EXTRACT_GENERIC_FIELDS_JSON}}

node_extract_skus:
{{NODE_EXTRACT_SKUS_JSON}}

node_extract_insurance:
{{NODE_EXTRACT_INSURANCE_JSON}}

node_extract_performance_penalties:
{{NODE_EXTRACT_PERFORMANCE_PENALTIES_JSON}}

node_extract_pricing_and_partnership
{{NODE_EXTRACT_PRICING_AND_PARTNERSHIP_JSON}}

node_extract_contract_digest
{{NODE_EXTRACT_CONTRACT_DIGEST_JSON}}

Combine these into a single JSON object as 
{{TEMPLATE_JSON}}

If any keys are not present or keys are incorrect try to correct them based on the context provided in the template. If a key is not applicable or not found, set its value to null or an empty string as appropriate. Ensure that the final JSON object strictly adheres to the structure and key names of the provided template.
