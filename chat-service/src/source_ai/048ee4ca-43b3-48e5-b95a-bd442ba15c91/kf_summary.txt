- **Rationale with data**: e.g., spend concentration, benchmark deviation, outlier pricing, supplier fragmentation, etc.
- **Explain the implication** in business terms: risk mitigation, savings potential, or strategic value.

Repeat this format for each relevant row or grouping in the data.

### üåê Language Guidelines (Internal only)

5. Summarize the data to create a concise summary.
6. Use markdown formatting for the entire output.
7. Never return the SQL query or user question in the final summary.
